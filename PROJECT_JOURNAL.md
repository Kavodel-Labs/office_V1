# Project Aethelred: Debugging and Refactoring Journal

This document chronicles the debugging and refactoring process undertaken to get the Aethelred project into a runnable and testable state.

## Initial State (As of June 30, 2025)

The project was received in a non-functional state. The core claim was that it was an autonomous AI agent workforce, but the application would not start, and the initial entry points were unclear. The primary interface was described as a complex Slack integration.

## Phase 1: Initial Diagnosis and Configuration

My first steps were to understand the codebase and identify the immediate blockers.

1.  **Missing Environment (`.env`):** The application required a `.env` file for critical environment variables (API keys, database credentials), which was missing. I created a `.env.example` to document the required variables.
2.  **Incomplete Configuration (`aethelred-config.yaml`):** The primary YAML configuration file was missing the entire `agora` block, which is essential for the agent consensus engine. I added the necessary configuration structure.
3.  **Incorrect Startup Procedure:** Initial attempts to run the application via `python main.py` failed because the system is architected as a distributed collection of services. It requires several databases (Redis, PostgreSQL, Neo4j) to be running and accessible. The correct startup method was identified as using Docker Compose.

## Phase 2: Strategic Pivot to a Local UI

The Slack integration proved to be a significant bottleneck for debugging. It was complex, required extensive setup, and obscured the core functionality of the agent system. To simplify, we made a strategic decision to pivot to a local web-based user interface.

This had several advantages:
*   **Decoupling:** It separated the core agent logic from the complexities of the Slack API.
*   **Rapid Testing:** It provided a direct, real-time way to interact with the agents without external dependencies.
*   **Clarity:** It simplified the project structure, making it easier for new developers to understand.

**Architectural Changes:**

1.  **Backend Server:** I created a new FastAPI server in `web_server.py`. This server exposes a simple `/chat` endpoint to receive user messages and send back agent responses via a WebSocket.
2.  **Frontend Interface:** I created a new `local_ui.html` file. This is a self-contained HTML page with JavaScript to handle the WebSocket connection, display the chat interface, and communicate with the backend.
3.  **Main Entry Point:** I modified `main.py` to launch the new FastAPI web server instead of the old Slack components.
4.  **Documentation:** The `README.md` was updated to reflect this new, simpler setup.
5.  **Code Cleanup:** I removed numerous obsolete Slack-related scripts and test files that were no longer relevant.

## Phase 3: Docker Environment Failures

With the new local UI in place, we attempted to launch the full application stack using the primary Docker Compose file (`config/docker-compose.dev.yml`). This uncovered a series of critical issues with the user's Docker environment.

1.  **Missing `Dockerfile.dev`:** The compose file referenced a non-existent Dockerfile. I created it, specifying a multi-stage build to handle both Node.js (`task-master-ai`) and Python dependencies.
2.  **Build Context Error:** The initial build failed because the Docker `context` was misconfigured in the compose file, preventing it from finding `requirements.txt`. I corrected the path.
3.  **Corrupted Docker Cache:** Subsequent builds began failing with a persistent, low-level `input/output error` when trying to write to the build cache (`/var/lib/docker/buildkit/metadata_v2.db`). This error occurred even after a system restart and after Docker's own `hello-world` test passed, indicating deep-seated corruption in the build cache.
4.  **Root Cause Identified:** The final attempt to prune the Docker build cache (`docker builder prune -a`) failed with a new, more explicit error: **`No space left on device`**.

## Conclusion & Current Status

**The project code is now in a clean, simplified, and runnable state.** The original, non-functional Slack integration has been replaced by a local web UI for direct interaction and testing. All necessary configurations and Dockerfiles have been created and corrected.

**The single blocking issue is the user's local environment.** The host machine has run out of disk space, which is the root cause of the persistent Docker I/O errors. Docker cannot build the application images without sufficient free space.

**Next Steps:**
1.  The user must free up a significant amount of disk space on their machine.
2.  Once disk space is available, the command `docker compose -f config/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build` should be re-run.
3.  With a healthy Docker environment and sufficient disk space, this command is expected to succeed, launching the entire Aethelred application stack.
4.  The system can then be accessed via the `local_ui.html` file.
